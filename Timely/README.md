# Timely - A Python Timer App

<p align="center">
<img src="assests/main.png" width=40% height=40%>

## üõ†Ô∏è Description
Timely is a simple Python-based timer application made using the Tkinter library.
My goal for this project was to implement my own application, so others can use it, or contribute to it.
I have been making contributions to other open source projects, so thought it would be nice to create my
own and flip the script. Timely allows users tp set a timer, start it, and stop it with just two buttons.
The graphical interface is simple, and leaves room for expansion. A visual countdown of the timer is also
displayed, as well as an alert once the timer has finished.

Feel free to fork the project, download the Python files, and edit them as you wish. You can also contribute by:

1. Improving functionality
2. Fixing bugs
3. Adding new features (such as countdown sounds, notifications, or customizable themes)
Even a small contribution is appreciated!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Languages or Frameworks Used
- Modules Required:
    - python (3.12.7)
